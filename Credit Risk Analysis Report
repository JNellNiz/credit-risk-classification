# Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to train and evaluate machine learning models for assessing loan risk using historical lending data. The goal was to develop a model that accurately determines the creditworthiness of borrowers.

The data includes lending activity, borrower profiles, loan details, and associated risk factors.

The machine learning process included data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. Logistic Regression was employed to train the models and make predictions.


Results:

Accuracy Score: The machine learning models achieved an accuracy of 99%, indicating high accuracy in correctly classifying loan statuses as either healthy or high-risk.

Precision Score: The precision score for predicting healthy loans (0) was 1.00, meaning that the model was able to correctly identify all instances of healthy loans.

Recall Score: The recall score for high-risk loans (1) was 0.89, suggesting that the model identified a majority of high-risk loans.


Summary:

The model's impressive accuracy of 0.99 predicts loan outcomes with 99% accuracy.

However, it's important to go beyond numerical analysis.  By including additional data sources like qualitative information and expert insights, credit risk evaluation can be further optimized.
